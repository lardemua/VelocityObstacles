		This function starts by going through all the current leafs on the tree, for each leaf/hypothesis go through all
		targets and for each target check which measurements fall within its gate and add those measurements to the hypothesis cluster.
		
		This is called measurement to cluster assignment, the end result is the cluster_assignemnt map.
		
		The following step checks if measurements belong to more that one cluster and merges those clusters, if a measurement is 
		shared this means that both clusters should be evaluated simultaneously. The merging of clusters is complicated: the first
		step is to define which cluster name will remain and which will disappear, I choose the first assigned to the measurement
		(for no particular reason). Then we go through all clusters associated with the measurement changing the associated hypothesis
		to the new cluster and all measurements associated with this cluster changing their association as well.
		In the end all clusters have different measurements without any overlap.
		
		The next step is to create the list of problems to solve, each problem is a association of all the measurements of that cluster
		with the hypothesis that the cluster contains. This problems will be solved using the Murty algorithm with the Hungarian as a lower
		layer.
		
		There are still a few steps missing ...
		
		In the end, all measurements that were not associated with any cluster will create new clusters with a single hypothesis
		and a single target. This step makes the global tree grow.
